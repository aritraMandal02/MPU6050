===================================================================================================
1. Upload the MPU6050_DMP6_eg.ino code to your Arduino UNO or Arduino Nano board. Note the COM Port.
2. Download MPU6050 library and include this library to your Arduino IDE.
3. Download processing from this link : https://processing.org/download
4. Download the processing libraries and paste them to '...\processing-4.0b2\modes\java\libraries' folder.
5. Open the MPUTeapot processing code. In line 74, change the COM Port to your COM port. 
6. Run the processing code.
7. Test your MPU6050.
